# Drupal9-lando-dev-site-creator
This project allows linux/ubuntu users to quickly set up a local Drupal 9 development site using lando. I created a bash script to do this which asks a number of questions before automatically setting up the site. This is a personal project based on automating the steps in this article.. https://matti.dev/post/setup-install-drupal-9-with-composer-and-drush. The script installs and enables a few modules that I have found useful in local development. You may want to customise it yourself so it does the things you want. I hope to make changes to it so that the drupal config is handled differently in the future.
